Hi everyone! My name is Ana√Øs. Little backstory about me: this is my first time creating a small business on my own, so you can be sure everying is being individually processed with care. When I was younger, my mom used to sew me beautiful dresses on her free time. This inspired me to start sewing childrens clothes, with the mentorship of my mom. Each dress is unique and made with care. Remember, making these indiviual articles of clothing can take anywhere from 4 hours to several days, so we price our products according to the cost of materials as well as the time it takes to make them.
